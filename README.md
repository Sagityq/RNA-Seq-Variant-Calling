## RNA-Seq Variant Calling Pipeline 
 This workflow is based on calling variants on RNA-Seq data using GATK4. the pipeline starts all the  way from raw Fastq files and end up with giving the VCF files. 

 ## Main Steps 

 ###Mapping to the Reference
 * Tools involved:[STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)
We begin with mapping RNA reads to a reference, we recommend using STAR aligner because it increased sensitivity compared to TopHat (especially for INDELS). We use STARâ€™s two-pass mode to get better alignments around novel splice junctions.
